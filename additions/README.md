# FreeBindCraft Additions for IPSAE

This folder contains FreeBindCraft-specific code added on top of the vendored
DunbrackLab/IPSAE repository.

Original upstream IPSAE files remain in `dependencies/IPSAE/`:

- `ipsae.py`
- `af2rechain.py`
- `README.md`
- `LICENSE`
- `Example/`

FreeBindCraft-added files live here in `dependencies/IPSAE/additions/`:

- `paths.py`: repository root constants, project-root resolution, and upload path helpers.
- `naming.py`: model/output filename helpers for ipSAE runs.
- `af3_pairing.py`: AlphaFold 3 structure/PAE filename pairing validation.
- `ui_helpers.py`: shared ipywidgets styling and display helpers for notebook UIs.
- `folder_picker.py`: reusable folder dropdown + refresh controls for notebook UIs.
- `uploads.py`: upload normalization, file saving, and safe zip extraction under `upload/`.
- `upload_widgets.py`: reusable FileUpload / zip / uploaded-folder picker widgets.
- `ipsae_eval_ui.py`: ipywidgets UI wiring for single-model and bulk evaluation.
- `ipsae_comparison_ui.py`: ipywidgets UI for summarizing collected outputs into a comparison CSV.
- `single_model_eval.py`: single-model execution, output collection, and score parsing.
- `bulk_eval.py`: AlphaFold Server folder discovery, batch execution, and run logging.
- `ipsae_evals_summary.py`: collected-output discovery and best-ipSAE summary CSV generation.
- `test_uploads.py`: focused unit tests for upload saving and zip safety.
- `README.md`: this note.

The UI calls the original upstream `../ipsae.py` script; it does not replace or
modify the DunbrackLab implementation.

## Single-model structure/PAE validation

Single-model evaluation runs a preflight check in `single_model_eval.py` before
calling `ipsae.py`. For AlphaFold 3 filenames, it requires:

- structure: `*_model_N.cif`
- PAE: `*_full_data_N.json`
- the same complex prefix, model index, and parent folder

Mismatches are rejected with a clear error, for example:

- same complex, different model index (`model_0` with `full_data_1`)
- different complexes (`fold_ifit5_l87_172_*` with `fold_ifit5_l68_*`)
- matching names in different folders

AF2 and Boltz pairing checks are not enforced yet; placeholders are left for
future extension.

## File and folder uploads

Uploads are stored under the project root (FreeBindCraft when IPSAE is embedded,
or the IPSAE directory when standalone):

```text
<PROJECT_ROOT>/upload/files/          # single structure / PAE uploads
<PROJECT_ROOT>/upload/folders/<stem>/ # extracted bulk zip uploads
```

Single Model accepts `.pdb` / `.cif` structure uploads and `.json` / `.npz` PAE
uploads. Choosing a file fills the existing path text box with the saved path
(same basename overwrites).

Bulk Evaluation: upload a full AlphaFold Server export zip via the JupyterLab
file browser (left sidebar), paste the zip path into **Zip path**, and click
**Extract zip**. Archives are capped at 2 GB compressed / 5 GB extracted (with
zip-slip and bomb checks). The optional widget **Upload zip** uses the same
cap, but the file browser is more reliable for large multi-job AF3 folders.

Extracted zips land in `upload/folders/<zip-stem>/` (existing folder with that
name is deleted first). You can also type any server-side folder path directly
into **AF3 folder**. Direct folder upload is not supported; use zip.

## Bulk evaluation input format

The notebook Bulk Evaluation tab currently supports AlphaFold Server-style AF3
exports only. Boltz folder discovery is not supported yet; use Single Model for
Boltz outputs.

Point the tab at a parent folder containing one subfolder per complex (type a
path or upload a zip of that layout), for example:

```text
AF3_outputs/
  fold_binder_001/
    fold_binder_001_model_0.cif
    fold_binder_001_full_data_0.json
    fold_binder_001_summary_confidences_0.json
  fold_binder_002/
    fold_binder_002_model_0.cif
    fold_binder_002_full_data_0.json
```

Click `Find models` to preview discovered models before running. By default the
UI fetches each matching `*_model_0.cif` file and pairs it with the corresponding
`*_full_data_0.json` file in the same complex folder. AlphaFold Server ranks
structures from 0 to 4, where model 0 is the highest-confidence prediction.

Each bulk ipSAE run creates a fresh timestamped folder such as
`bulk_ipsae_evals_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`. Inside that folder, each model gets its own
subfolder named from the structure filename, containing the copied ipSAE output
files. The root of the timestamped folder also contains a log named from the
folder, such as `bulk_ipsae_evals_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_log.json`, which records the
AF3 folder, selected model index, discovered models, and success/failure counts
for that run.

## Summary comparison

Summary comparison is separate from running ipSAE. Use the **Step 5: ipSAE Comparison CSV**
cell in `notebooks/ipsae_eval.ipynb` to enter a folder path that already contains collected
ipSAE metric outputs, such as `ipsae_evals/` or a `bulk_ipsae_evals_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/`
folder. The summary ranks models by the best ipSAE row per model and can save the comparison
table to CSV. When the CSV field is just a filename, it is saved inside the selected
metrics folder.
